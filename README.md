# 🍎 Apple Leaf Disease Classification with CNN and Grad-CAM

This project focuses on the **classification of apple leaf diseases** using a **custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and provides **visual explanations with Grad-CAM**.  
The goal is to help in early detection of apple diseases to support **precision agriculture** and improve crop yield.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Custom **CNN model** trained on apple leaf disease dataset.
- Supports classification of **Black Rot, Apple Scab, Cedar Rust, and Healthy leaves**.
- **Grad-CAM visualization** for interpretable AI, showing disease-affected regions.
- Data augmentation for better generalization.
- End-to-end pipeline: **training → evaluation → visualization**.
